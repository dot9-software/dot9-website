We have been really impressed by the quality of services we received. Blue Canvas can definitely recommend dot9 to everyone looking for high-quality, highly-flexible engineering solutions. They worked on integrating Blue Canvas with external services, and what was particularly delightful was the quality and independence with which they designed and implemented those integrations across dozens of technologies (Java, React, Express.js etc...) and hard-to-understand APIs (Jira, Azure). They charge reasonable prices, are professional and courteous in dealings, and deliver our items, even ones outside the original scope.",

Unfortunately, we only had the capacity to build an iOS version of the app. Of course, we also wanted to serve the Android market ASAP. This is where dot9 came into play for us: In record time dot9 was able to port the iOS app to Android and thus enabled us to have a successful product launch. The quality of the delivered software and also the consulting was highly satisfactory. I would especially like to emphasize how smooth the cooperation was: no administrative effort, extremely high level of independence, early escalation of potential problems. During the whole project we could concentrate on our own work and just let dot9 do it. Just as you would want from a technology partner.",
