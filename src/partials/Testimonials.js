We have been really impressed by the quality of services we received. Blue Canvas can definitely recommend dot9 to everyone looking for high-quality, highly-flexible engineering solutions. They worked on integrating Blue Canvas with external services, and what was particularly delightful was the quality and independence with which they designed and implemented those integrations across dozens of technologies (Java, React, Express.js etc...) and hard-to-understand APIs (Jira, Azure). They charge reasonable prices, are professional and courteous in dealings, and deliver our items, even ones outside the original scope.",
